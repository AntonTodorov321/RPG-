### Description

This is complex console game. The game takes place on a 10x10 grid where players control characters belonging to three different races: Warrior, Mage, and Archer. Monsters, represented by â—™, spawn randomly on the grid, every turn. Health and mana are displayed above the grid. 

### Rules

Before embarking on your journey, you have the opportunity to customize your preferred character. You have the option to boost your character's stats by allocating up to 3 additional points. Then you have 2 choices:
<ul>
  <li>
      <b>Move:</b> players navigate the grid using specific keys (W, A, S, D, E, X, Q, Z) for movement. Any attempt to move beyond the boundaries of the 10x10 grid or jumping onto a space occupied by a monster will result in an automatic turn skip. So don't do that, because monsters are coming for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Attack:</b>Upon selecting the attack option in the console, players will be presented with a list of monsters within their range, along with their current health status. Then you can choose which monster to attack.</li>
